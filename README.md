# OAuth Demo
An node/express app that uses Google to authenticate a user in this app. Created from a tutorial by Net Ninja, https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jdm7QX143aMLAqyM-jTZ2x&amp;si=JVb18JfY9m82AJwh

## Does Not Work As-Is
This application will not work as-is.

You will need to create you own `.env` file, based on te `.env.sample` provided.

Before that, you will need to set up Google Authentication for your app and set up a MongoDb.

**Google**: https://console.cloud.google.com/

**MongoDB**: https://cloud.mongodb.com/

If going over that without help is daunting (perfectly fine, if so,) I suggest following Net Ninja's course (link above.) It's a bit dated in some details, but covers all the concepts.
